\section{Overview}

\bruno{Jeremy: can you give this section a go and start writing it up? I think this section should be your priority for now.}

\subsection{Explicit Reduction Rules}

Contrast our calculus with the calculus of constructions. Explain fold/unfold. 

\subsection{Decidability and Strong Normalization}

Informally explain that with explicit fold/unfold rules the decidability of the 
type system does not depend on strong normalization.

\subsection{Unifying Recursive Types and Recursion}

Show how in \name recursion and recursive types are unified. 
Discuss that due to this unification the sensible choice for the 
evaluation strategy is call-by-name. 

\subsection{Encoding Datatypes}

Informally explain how to encode recursive datatypes and recursive functions 
using datatypes.
