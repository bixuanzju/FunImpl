\section{The Explicit Calculus of Constructions with Recursion}

\bruno{Linus and Jeremy, I think you should do this section together. Most work is on Linus though since he needs to work out the proofs. Jeremy is mostly for Linus to consult with here :).}

This section shows how to extend $\lambda C\beta$ with recursion. This extension 
allows the calculus to account for both: 1) recursive definitions; 2) recursive types. 
The extension preserves the decidability and soundness of the type system.
