\section{The Explicit Calculus of Constructions with Recursion}

This section shows how to extend $\lambda C\beta$ with recursion. This extension 
allows the calculus to account for both: 1) recursive definitions; 2) recursive types. 
The extension preserves the decidability and soundness of the type system.
