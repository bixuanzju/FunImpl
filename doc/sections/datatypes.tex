\section{Surface language}
\label{sec:surface}

\bruno{Jeremy, I think you should write up this section.}

\begin{itemize}
\item Expand the core language with datatypes and pattern matching by encoding.
\item Give translation rules.
\item Encode GADTs and maybe other Haskell extensions? GADTs seems challenging, so perhaps some other examples would be datatypes like $Fix f$, and $Monad$ as a record. Could formalize records in Haskell style.  
\end{itemize}
