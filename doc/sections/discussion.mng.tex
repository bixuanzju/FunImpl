\paragraph{Erasure of \cast Operators}

Explicit type \cast operators $[[castup]]$ and $[[castdown]]$ are part of the core design of the language. They are generalized from $\kw{fold}$ and $\kw{unfold}$ of iso-recursive types. By convention, $[[castup]]$ follows $\kw{fold}$ as a value in the language, which means it cannot be further reduced during the evaluation. Thus, it is likely to have many $[[castup]]$ constructs leaving in terms after evaluation. This will be a performance issue when considering code generation -- too many $[[castup]]$ constructs will dramatically increase the size of the program, which causes runtime overhead and affects the performance of the language.

In fact, we can safely erase \cast operators during code generation, because they do not perform any real transformation of a term other than changing its type.
