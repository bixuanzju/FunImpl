\section{Overview}

This section informally introduces the main features of \name. In
particular, this section shows how the explicit casts in \name can be
used instead of the typical conversion rule present in calculi such as
the calculus of constructions. The formal details of \name are
presented in \S\ref{sec:ecore}.

\subsection{The Calculus of Constructions and the Conversion Rule}
\label{sec:coc}

The calculus of constructions (\coc)~\cite{coc} is a powerful
higher-order typed lambda calculus supporting dependent types (among
various other features).  A crutial
feature of \coc is the so-called \emph{conversion}
rule as shown below: \ottusedrule{\ottdruleTccXXConv{}}

%For the most part \name is similar to the \emph{Calculus of Constructions}
%(\coc)~\cite{coc}, which is a higher-order typed lambda calculus.
%However unlike \name and \coc is the
%absence of a conversion rule 

The conversion rule allows one to derive $e:[[t2]]$ from the
derivation of $e:[[t1]]$ and the $\beta$-equality of $[[t1]]$ and
$[[t2]]$. This rule is important to \emph{automatically} allows 
terms with equivalent types to be considered type-compatible. 
To illustrate, let us consider a simple example. Suppose
we have a built-in base type $[[int]]$ and \[f \equiv [[\x:(\y:star.y)int.x]] \]
Here $f$ is a simple identity function. However, the type 
of $x$ (i.e., $[[(\y:star.y)int]]$), which is the argument of $f$, is interesting: it is 
an identity function on types, applied to an integer. 
Without the conversion rule, $f$ cannot be
applied to, say $3$ in \coc. However, given that $f$ is actually
$\beta$-convertible to $[[\x:int.x]]$, the conversion rule allows
the application of $f$ to $3$ by implicitly converting
$[[\x:(\y:star.y)int.x]]$ to $[[\x:int.x]]$.

\paragraph{Decidability of Type-Checking and Strong Normalization} 
While the conversion rule in \coc brings alot of convenience, an unfortunate
consequence is that it couples decidability of type-checking with 
strong normalization of the calculus~\cite{coc:decidability}. 
However strong normalization does not
hold with general recursion. This is simply because due to the
conversion rule, any non-terminating term would force the type checker
to go into an infinitely loop (by constantly applying the conversion
rule without termination), thus rendering the type system undecidable.
\bruno{show simple example. Explain issue better.}

\subsection{An Alternative to the Conversion Rule: Explicit Casts}

\bruno{Mention somewhere that the cast rules do \emph{one-step} reductions.}
In contrast to the implicit reduction rules of \coc, \name makes it
explicit as to when and where to convert one type to another. Type
conversions are explicit by introducing two language constructs: $[[castup]]$
(beta expansion) and $[[castdown]]$ (beta reduction). The benefit of
this approach is that decidability of type-checking no longer is
coupled with strong normalization of the calculus.

\paragraph{Beta Expansion} The first of the two type conversions
$[[castup]]$, allows a type conversion provided that the resulting
type is a \emph{beta expansion} of the original type of the term.
Consider the same example
from \S\ref{sec:coc}. In \name, $f\,3$ is an ill-typed
application. Instead we must write the application as \[
f\,([[castup[(\y:star.y)int] three]]) \]\bruno{how to put a space
  before $3$?} The intuition is that,
$[[castup]]$ is actually doing a type conversion since the type of $ 3 $
is $ [[int]] $ and $ [[(\y:star.y)int]] $ can be reduced to $ [[int]]
$.\bruno{explain why this is a beta expansion}\bruno{explain why 
for beta expansions we need to provide the resulting type as
argument}. 

\paragraph{Beta Reduction}
The dual operation of $[[castup]]$ is $[[castdown]]$, which allows a
type conversion provided that the resulting type is a \emph{beta
  reduction} of the original type of the term. The use of
$[[castdown]]$ is better explained by another similar example. Suppose
that \[ g \equiv [[\x:int.x]] \] and term $z$ has type \[
[[(\y:star.y)int]] \] $ g\,z $ is again an ill-typed application,
while $ g\,([[castdown z]]) $ is type correct because $[[castdown]]$
reduces the type of $ z $ to $ [[int]] $. \bruno{explain why this is a reduction}

\subsection{Decidability without Strong Normalization}

With explicit type conversion rules the decidability of type-checking 
no longer depends on the normalization property. 
A nice consequence of this is that the type system remains decidable
even in the presence of non-terminating programs at type level.
%As we will see in later sections. The
%ability to write non-terminating terms motivates us to have more
%control over type-level computation. 
To illustrate, let us consider the following example. Suppose that $d$ is a ``dependent type'' where
\[d : [[int -> star]]\] so that $d\,3$ or $d\,100$ all yield the same
type. With general recursion at hand, we can image a term $z$ that has
type \[d\,\mathsf{loop}\] where $\mathsf{loop}$ stands for any
diverging computation and of type $[[int]]$. What would happen if we
try to type check the following application: \[ [[(\x: d three.x)z]]\]
Under the normal typing rules of \coc, the type checker would get
stuck as it tries to do $\beta$-equality on two terms: $d\,3$ and
$d\,\mathsf{loop}$, where the latter is non-terminating.

This is not the case for \name: \name has no conversion rule,
therefore the type checker would do syntactic comparison between the
two terms instead of $\beta$-equality in the above example and reject
the program as ill-typed. Indeed it would be impossible to type-check
the program even with the use of $[[castup]]$ and/or $[[castdown]]$:
one would need to write infinite number of $[[castdown]]$'s to make
the type checker loop forever (e.g., $([[\x:d
three.x]])([[castdown]]([[castdown]] \dots z) $), but it is impossible
to write such program in reality.

In summary, \name achieves the decidability of type checking by
explicitly controlling type-level computation.  which is independent of
the normalization property, while supporting general recursion at the
same time.

\subsection{Recursion and Recursive Types}
\label{sec:overview:recursion}

\bruno{Show how in \name recursion and recursive types are unified.
Discuss that due to this unification the sensible choice for the
evaluation strategy is call-by-name. }

A simple extension to \name is to add a simple recursion construct.
With such an extension, it becomes possible to write standard
recursive programs at the term level. At the same time, the recursive
construct can also be used to model recursive types at the type-level.
Therefore, \name differs from other programming languages in that it
unifies both recursion and recursive types by the same $\mu$
primitive. With a single language construct we get two powerful
features!

\paragraph{Recursion}

The $\mu$ primitive is used to define recursive functions.
For example the factorial function is defined as follows: 
\[\miu{f}{\mathsf{Int} \rightarrow
  \mathsf{Int}}{\lam{x}{\mathsf{Int}}{\mathsf{if}\,(x ==
    0)\,\mathsf{then}\,1\,\mathsf{else}\,x * f\,(x - 1)}}\] 
This is reflected by the dynamic semantics of the $\mu$ primitive:
\[\miu{x}{T}{E} \longrightarrow E[x:=\miu{x}{T}{E}]\]
which is exactly doing recursive unfolding of the same term.

% The dynamic semantics of $\mu$ requires the recursive binder to satisfy (omit type annotations for clarity):  \[ \mu f.\,E = (\lambda f.\,E) (\mu f.\,E) \] which, however, does not terminate in strict languages. Therefore, to loosen the function-type restriction to allow any types, the sensible choice for the evaluation strategy is \emph{call-by-name}.

\subsubsection{Recursive types}
In the literature on type systems, there are two approaches to
recursive types. One is called \emph{equi-recursive}, the other
\emph{iso-recursive}. The \emph{iso-recursive}
approach treats a recursive type and its unfolding as different, but
isomorphic. The isomorphism between a recursive type and it's one step 
unfolding is witnessed by traditionally $fold$ and $unfold$
operations.\bruno{Explain that the casts generalize fold and unfold!}
In \name, this is witnessed by first $[[castup]]$, then
$[[castdown]]$. A classic example of recursive types is the so-called
``hungry'' type: $H = \miu{\sigma}{\star}{\mathsf{Int} \rightarrow
  \sigma}$. A term $z$ of type $H$ can accept any number of numeric
arguments and return a new function that is hungry for more, as
illustrated below:

\begin{align*}
[[castdown z]] &: [[int]][[->]]H  \\
[[castdown(castdown z)]] &: [[int]][[->]][[int]][[->]]H \\
[[castdown]]([[castdown]] \dots z) &: [[int]][[->]][[int]][[->]]\dots[[->]]H
\end{align*}

Due to the unification of recursive types and recursion, we can use
the same $\mu$ primitive to write both recursive types and recursion
with ease.

\paragraph{Call-by-Name}
Due to the unification, the \emph{call-by-value} evaluation strategy
does not fit in our setting. In call-by-value evaluation, recursion
can be expressed by the recursive binder $\mu$ as $\mu f : T
\rightarrow T.\, E$ (note that the type of $f$ is restricted to
function types). Since we don't want to pose restrictions on the
types, the \emph{call-by-name} evaluation is a sensible choice.
\bruno{Probably needs to be improved. I'll came back to this later!}

\subsection{Logical Inconsistency}

\bruno{Explain that the \name is inconsistent and discuss that this is
  a deliberate design decision, since we want to model languages like
  Haskell, which are logically inconsistent as well.} \bruno{Discuss
  the $* : *$ rule: since we already have inconsistency, having this
  rule adds expressiveness and simplifies the system.} 

\subsection{Encoding Datatypes}


With the explicit type conversion rules and the $\mu$ primitive, it is
easy to encode recursive datatypes and recursive functions using
datatypes. While inductive datatypes can be encoded using either the
Church or the Scott encoding, we adopt the Scott encoding as it
encodes case analysis, making it more convenient to
encode pattern matching. We demonstrate the encoding method using a
simple datatype as a running example: the natural numbers.

The datatype declaration for natural numbers is:
\begingroup\par\noindent\advance\leftskip\mathindent\(
\begin{pboxed}\SaveRestoreHook
\column{B}{@{}>{\hspre}l<{\hspost}@{}}%
\column{4}{@{}>{\hspre}l<{\hspost}@{}}%
\column{E}{@{}>{\hspre}l<{\hspost}@{}}%
\>[4]{}\mathbf{data}\;\Conid{Nat}\mathrel{=}\Conid{Z}\mid \Conid{S}\;\Conid{Nat};{}\<[E]%
\ColumnHook
\end{pboxed}
\)\par\noindent\endgroup\resethooks
In the Scott encoding, the encoding of the \emph{Nat} type reflects
how its two constructors are going to be used. Since \emph{Nat} is a
recursive datatype, we have to use recursive types at some point to
reflect its recursive nature. As it turns out, the \emph{Nat} type can
be simply represented as \ensuremath{\mu\;\Conid{Nat}\mathbin{:}\star.\,\Pi\;\Conid{B}\mathbin{:}\star.\,\Conid{B}\to (\Conid{Nat}\to \Conid{B})\to \Conid{B}}.

As can be seen, in the function type \ensuremath{\Conid{B}\to (\Conid{Nat}\to \Conid{B})\to \Conid{B}}, $B$
corresponds to the type of the \emph{Z} constructor, and \ensuremath{\Conid{X}\to \Conid{B}}
corresponds to the type of the \emph{S} constructor. The intuition is
that any use of the datatype being defined in the constructors is
replaced with the recursive type, except for the return type, which is
a type variable for use in the recursive functions.

Now its two constructors can be encoded correspondingly as below:
\begin{figure}[h!]
\begingroup\par\noindent\advance\leftskip\mathindent\(
\begin{pboxed}\SaveRestoreHook
\column{B}{@{}>{\hspre}l<{\hspost}@{}}%
\column{3}{@{}>{\hspre}l<{\hspost}@{}}%

\column{E}{@{}>{\hspre}l<{\hspost}@{}}%
\>[3]{}\mathbf{let}\;\Conid{Z}\mathbin{:}\Conid{Nat}\mathrel{=}\mathsf{cast}^\uparrow\;[\mskip1.5mu \Conid{Nat}\mskip1.5mu]\;(\lambda \Conid{B}\mathbin{:}\star.\,\lambda \Varid{z}\mathbin{:}\Conid{B}.\,\lambda \Varid{f}\mathbin{:}\Conid{Nat}\to \Conid{B}.\,\Varid{z}){}\<[E]%
\\
\>[3]{}\mathbf{in}{}\<[E]%
\\
\>[3]{}\mathbf{let}\;\Conid{S}\mathbin{:}\Conid{Nat}\to \Conid{Nat}\mathrel{=}\lambda \Varid{n}\mathbin{:}\Conid{Nat}.\,{}\<[E]%
\\

\>[5]{}\mathsf{cast}^\uparrow\;[\mskip1.5mu \Conid{Nat}\mskip1.5mu]\;(\lambda \Conid{B}\mathbin{:}\star.\,\lambda \Varid{z}\mathbin{:}\Conid{B}.\,\lambda \Varid{f}\mathbin{:}\Conid{Nat}\to \Conid{B}.\,\Varid{f}\;\Varid{n}){}\<[E]%
\ColumnHook
\end{pboxed}
\)\par\noindent\endgroup\resethooks
\end{figure}

Thanks to the explicit type conversion rules, we can make use of the $[[castup]]$ operation to do type conversion between the recursive type and its unfolding.

As the last example, let us see how we can define recursive functions using the \emph{Nat} datatype. A simple example would be recursively adding two natural numbers, which can be defined as below:

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begingroup\par\noindent\advance\leftskip\mathindent\(
\begin{pboxed}\SaveRestoreHook
\column{B}{@{}>{\hspre}l<{\hspost}@{}}%
\column{3}{@{}>{\hspre}l<{\hspost}@{}}%
\column{5}{@{}>{\hspre}l<{\hspost}@{}}%
\column{7}{@{}>{\hspre}l<{\hspost}@{}}%
\column{E}{@{}>{\hspre}l<{\hspost}@{}}%
\>[3]{}\mathbf{let}\;\Varid{add}\mathbin{:}\Conid{Nat}\to \Conid{Nat}\to \Conid{Nat}\mathrel{=}\mu\;\Varid{f}\mathbin{:}\Conid{Nat}\to \Conid{Nat}\to \Conid{Nat}.\,{}\<[E]%
\\
\>[3]{}\hsindent{2}{}\<[5]%
\>[5]{}\lambda \Varid{n}\mathbin{:}\Conid{Nat}.\,\lambda \Varid{m}\mathbin{:}\Conid{Nat}.\,{}\<[E]%
\\
\>[5]{}\hsindent{2}{}\<[7]%
\>[7]{}(\mathsf{cast}_\downarrow\;\Varid{n})\;\Conid{Nat}\;\Varid{m}\;(\lambda \Varid{n'}\mathbin{:}\Conid{Nat}.\,\Conid{S}\;(\Varid{f}\;\Varid{n'}\;\Varid{m})){}\<[E]%
\ColumnHook
\end{pboxed}
\)\par\noindent\endgroup\resethooks
\end{figure}

As we can see, the above definition quite resembles case analysis common in modern functional programming languages. (Actually we formalize the encoding of case analysis in \S\ref{sec:surface}.)
